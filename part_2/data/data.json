Of these swords, the Type XVI swords have a flat cutting blade which tapers to an acute point reinforced by a clearly defined ridge, making it equally effective for thrusting. This type somewhat resembles a more slender version of type XIV. Blade length c. 70â€“80cm. Subtype XVIa have a longer blade with a shorter fuller (usually running down 1/3 and rarely exceeding 1/2 of the blade). The grip is often extended to accommodate one and a half or two hands."

		"name":"Flanged Mace",
		"origin": "Earliest references to the Byzantine Empire",
		"date": "5th to 15th Century",
		"description": "A mace is a simple weapon that uses a heavy head on the end of a handle to deliver powerful blows.During the Middle Ages metal armour such as mail protected against the blows of edged weapons, so variants of the standard mace were created to penetrate said armour. One example of a mace capable of penetrating armour is the flanged mace. The flanges allow it to dent or penetrate thick armour. Flange maces did not become popular until after knobbed maces. Although there are some references to flanged maces (bardoukion) as early as the Byzantine Empire c. 900, it is commonly accepted that the flanged mace did not become popular in Europe until the 12th century, when it was concurrently developed in Russia and Mid-west Asia.
